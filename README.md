# Vaccination Platform
A web application written on ASP.NET and the MVC architectural pattern, combined with a small portion of jQuery and Vanilla JS for client-side rendering. 
The plattform is used for registering users that can then book a place for vaccination in almost every city and hospital in Bulgaria.
The application is a demo/simulation for educational purposes and does not have any integration with the real life systems in the used hospitals.
